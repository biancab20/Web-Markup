        <h2>Dinner Train</h2>
        <p>
          Why do the same thing when it can be done differently? Offering dinner
          is widely known. Traveling by train too, everyone knows the yellow
          blue trains of NS in the Netherlands. Dining on a moving train? Why
          not! A special experience with recognizable elements, that's how you
          could describe Dinner Train. We want to offer our guests something
          they have not experienced before, but still keep it accessible so that
          everyone can use it.
