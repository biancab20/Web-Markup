        <p class="p-left">Why do the same thing when it can be done differently? Offering dinner is widely known. Traveling by train too, everyone knows the yellow blue trains of NS in the Netherlands. Dining on a moving train? Why not! A special experience with recognizable elements, that's how you could describe Dinner Train. We want to offer our guests something they have not experienced before, but still keep it accessible so that everyone can use it.</p>
